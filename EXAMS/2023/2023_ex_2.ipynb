      "   • If the curve bends:\n",

      "     The bigger this value, the more the curve bends!\n",
      "\n",
      "5. WHY THE SQUARE ROOT?\n",
      "   sqrt(x² + y²) calculates the distance\n",
      "   We want the 'amount' of bending, not the direction\n",

      "   Adds up all the individual bending values\n",
      "   Divides by number of points to get the average\n",

      "8. WHAT THE RESULT TELLS YOU:\n",
      "   • Low number (close to 0): Smooth, straight-ish curve\n",
      "   • High number: Very jagged, lots of sharp turns\n",
      "   • For your data: 5.206167 means moderate curviness\n",
